# Contributing

If you would like to contribute code to this project, you can do so by forking
the repository and sending a merge request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. This project
adheres to the [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) code style, with a
few modifications:

* Avoid lines longer than **80** characters
* Leading underscores for "private" properties (by convention only) are OK
* Valid JSDoc comments are required (where provided)

If adding new functionality, please be sure to include the appropriate tests
as well. All tests must pass before a merge can be accepted.

Thank you.
